//The need <code>
I, the <user>, want to be at an <event.type> and quickly / easily <contact.exchange>
& <contacts.store> information with other like-minded <users> no matter the browser
type or phone type, while also receiving a reminder when to <user.followUp>
with my <user.contacts>.

-------- Value proposition


As a user of this application I'm often at networking events / business meetings /
conventions & I need to be able to quickly and easily exchange digital contact information
with my new friends. Current technology makes it so I either have to write this
information down, exchange physical business cards, manually enter this information
in multiple places or hope that my new friends also share the same
technology platforms that I do.

---Acceptance Criteria  / Definition of Done

When I enter this app I want to be able to quickly complete the task of saving
my new contacts' information. The log-in process should be effortless and minimal.
Being able to log-in with credentials I've already saved elsewhere would be
preferable. Additionally I shouldn't need to log-in every time I open the app.

The profile creation should also be limited to only the most important / pertinent
information needed so I can know who my new contact is and how to follow-up
with him / her. It should include ability to attach an image, name, email, phone &
any of my new contacts' social media profiles.

The contact list should make it easy to find my follow-ups / new contacts. A way
to sort my contacts on a variety of criteria would be ideal. I'd also like to be able
to add new contacts and flag certain contact for follow-up while I'm scrolling
through my contact list.

Within each contact's profile I should be able to find a way to contact them without
having to search all over the place. Additionally, social media is more important than
ever so having a easy way to record & find each person's social media handle is crucial.
It'd also be nice to associate notes with each contact so I can remind myself what way
that person prefers to be contacted, where I met that person & what we were talking about
when we decided to exchange information.

When I'm at a conference or convention I don't want to be held up inputing each
and every piece of information. If I make a new connection & and they already have a
profile created I'd like to easily be able to search for their name, find their profile
and add them into my contact list.
